        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>If you're making steaks at home, you've come to the right place. This recipe is one that has been past down from my great-great-great grandmother. Please give it a go and let me know how it was for you.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 beef sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons steak seasoning</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
