# odin-recipes
Recipe project 

Introduction

This project is the first project of the Odin project. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the skills that have been taught in the previous lessons by creating a website that consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I am expecting to demonstrate my skills in creating a simple website using the knowledge that I have accumulated in HTML, e.g., Elements and Tags, HTML Boilerplate, Working with Text, Lists, Links and Images.
